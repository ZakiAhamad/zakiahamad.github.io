  A go-getter and a visionary with the core values of family, openness, honesty, and integrity looking to pursue my goals and ambitions. These goals include understanding my strengths and weaknesses so I can strive to be the best I can be and max out my potential for future success, higher education, and professionalism. I plan on majoring in computer science and pursuing a career as a game developer. I will achieve these goals by completing my studies and doing what I do well and love with a passion, programming.
